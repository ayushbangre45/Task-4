Actions Performed

1. Opened Firewall GUI:
   - Used `wf.msc` to access Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

2. Viewed Current Firewall Profiles:
   - Verified that all profiles are on and correctly blocking unsolicited inbound traffic.

3. Blocked Port 23 (Telnet):
   - Added a rule to block inbound TCP traffic on port 23 to prevent Telnet-based attacks.

4. Tested Configuration:
   - Verified rules were applied using the GUI and basic connectivity tests.
   - Removed the Telnet rule after testing to restore the system to default.



Summary

This configuration helps:
- Prevent unauthorized access on unused or risky ports (like 23 – Telnet).
- Apply policies consistently across all network profiles.
